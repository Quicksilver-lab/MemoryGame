# Steven Universe Memory Game (In Development)

Welcome to the **Steven Universe Memory Game**, a memory game project inspired by the _Steven Universe_ universe. This game is being developed in Python using the `tkinter` library for the graphical interface. The goal is to create a fun game where players can test their memory skills by matching iconic characters from the animated series!
